JBoss Data Grid (JDG) Quickstarts
===========================

Introduction
-------------

JBoss Data Grid (JDG) is an open source data grid platform that offers multiple clustered modes, but its true value is observed while running in distributed mode where caches cluster together and expose a large memory heap. 

JBoss Data Grid offers two usage modes:

* _Library mode_  - This mode provides all the binaries required to build and deploy a custom runtime environment. The library usage mode allows local access to a single node in a distributed cluster. This usage mode gives the application access to data grid functionality within a virtual machine in the container being used. Supported containers include JBoss AS 7, JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 and Tomcat 7. 
* _Client-server mode_ - This mode provides a managed, distributed and clusterable data grid server. Applications can remotely access the data grid server using Hot Rod, memcached or REST client APIs., the Cache is stored in  a managed, distributed and clusterable data grid server.  Applications can remotely access the data grid server using Hot Rod, memcached or REST client APIs. This web application bundles only the HotRod client and communicates with a remote JBoss Data Grid (JDG) server. The JDG server is configured via the `standalone.xml` configuration file.

The quickstarts included in this distribution were written to demonstrate JBoss Data Grid functionality and features. They provide small, specific, working examples that can be used as a reference for your own project.
